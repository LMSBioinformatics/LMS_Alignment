#### Note: Files are in "Data" directory

1. Read "ENCFF001LGM_chr1_chr2.fastq" fastq file using `ShortRead` package
    + What is the read length of the sequencing reads?
    + How many sequencing reads are in this fastq?
    + Plot the distribution of quality scores using `boxplot()` function (convert ASCII encoded values into matrix using `as(QualityValues, "matrix")` )
    + Plot the distribution of nucleotides by cycle (see `alphabetByCycle` help)
    + Generate Quality assessment report in HTML

2. Download and install FastQC from http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/
    + Import `ENCFF001QSC_chr1.fastq` in FastQC and generate HTML report
